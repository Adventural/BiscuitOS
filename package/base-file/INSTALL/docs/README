README - 0.98 Root Filesystem
Jim Winstead Jr. - 23 October 1992

There are no substantial changes from 0.97.1 to 0.98 but now the
jumptable libraries are used for everything, and the release should be
much cleaner - less bugs, more features. 

Unfortunately, this disk is still not very well suited to updating an
existing Linux system.  This will be addressed in future releases.
