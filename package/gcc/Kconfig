	help
	  The GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) is a compiler system 
	  produced by the GNU Project supporting various programming 
	  languages. GCC is a key component of the GNU toolchain and 
	  the standard compiler for most Unix-like Operating Systems. 
	  The Free Software Foundation (FSF) distributes GCC under the 
	  GNU General Public License (GNU GPL). GCC has played an 
	  important role in the growth of free software, as both a tool
	  and an example.
